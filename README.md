# SoupProject

_The can as it currently is, is subject to change (including the introduction of completely randomly colored can bodies)._

A Project that aims to take different reference images to create soup cans.

Personal Development aims for working with images within Python.

Currently, **Ghostscript** is required to use this. This is most likely going to stay this way.
